📢 Project Announcement: Secure API Gateway
Subtitle: "Simple. Secure. Smart."

🔑 Core Features
1. Token-Based Authentication

How it works: Users are authenticated via JWT (JSON Web Tokens). These tokens serve as digital keys, granting secure access to API endpoints.
Why it matters: Prevent unauthorized access by validating user identity at every request.

2. Logging for Auditing

How it works: Every API request is logged using Python’s built-in logging module.
Why it matters: Maintain a detailed record for forensic analysis and compliance.

3. Encryption of Sensitive Data

How it works: Secure critical data in transit and at rest using AES encryption (via the cryptography library).
Why it matters: Protect against data breaches and tampering.

🛠 Technical Blueprint
Feature	Framework/Library	Implementation Details
Authentication	Flask + jwt	JWT token creation, validation middleware
Encryption	cryptography	AES encryption for sensitive data
Request Logging	logging	Track endpoint hits with timestamps
